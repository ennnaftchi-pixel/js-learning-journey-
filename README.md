# JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured journey learning JavaScript in 28 days, with a focus on
understanding the language as a system rather than just syntax.

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in JavaScript fundamentals
- Understand JavaScript-specific behavior (scope, execution, async)
- Practice problem-solving using JavaScript
- Build small browser and API-based projects

## Structure
Each folder contains:
- Practice scripts
- Small exercises
- Notes or experiments when relevant

## Notes
- This repository is primarily for learning and experimentation.
- Code may not always be polished.
- Larger, refined projects will be separated into their own repositories.

## Technologies
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js
- Browser JavaScript (DOM)

## Status
🚧 In progress (for 28 days)
