# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository!  
This repo documents my ongoing journey exploring JavaScript through exercises, mini-projects, and experiments. The focus is on **building a solid foundation**, understanding **core concepts**, and **practicing problem-solving**.

I started this repository as part of my early JavaScript practice and continue to use it as a playground for learning and experimentation. It is intentionally **open-ended**, reflecting the continuous nature of learning programming.

---

## Goals

- Gain a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals (variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Explore JavaScript-specific behaviors (scope, execution context, asynchronous programming)
- Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking using JavaScript
- Build small, manageable projects to apply concepts in practice
- Learn to organize code, debug, and document work effectively

---

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a **learning session or mini-project**, for example:

- `day01/` — Basic scripts, console exercises, number analysis
- `day02/` — Mini-projects like grade analyzers and temperature analysis
- `day03/` — Functions and user input handling
- `day04/` — Student score management scripts

Each folder may include:

- Practice scripts
- Exercises or mini-projects
- Notes or experimental code

> **Note:** The folder names are chronological but do not represent a strict timeline.

## Notes

- This repository is for **learning and experimentation**.  
- Code may be **unpolished, repetitive, or simple** — that is intentional, as it reflects my early practice.  
- More refined or larger projects will be in **separate repositories**.  
- This repository demonstrates **progress over time**, not perfection.

---

## Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for console-based projects)
- Browser JavaScript (DOM manipulation)

---

## Status

📘 Ongoing learning journey — this repository will continue to evolve as I explore new concepts, practice exercises, and apply knowledge in small projects.
