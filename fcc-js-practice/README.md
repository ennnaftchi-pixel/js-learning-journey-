# Variables and Strings — JavaScript Practice

This folder contains my early JavaScript practice focused on:

- Declaring variables with `let` and `const`
- Reassigning variables
- String concatenation
- Console output
- Building sentences dynamically

## Project: Bot Introduction Script

A simple console-based script where a bot introduces itself using variables and string concatenation.

### Concepts Practiced

- Variable declaration and reassignment
- Constants
- String building with `+`
- Output using `console.log`

This is part of my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript fundamentals practice.
