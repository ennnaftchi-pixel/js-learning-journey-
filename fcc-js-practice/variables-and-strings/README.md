# Variables and Strings Practice

This folder contains my early JavaScript exercises focused on:

- Variable declaration (`let`, `const`)
- String concatenation
- Template literals
- Reassigning variables
- Console output

These scripts are small but important — they build the foundation for understanding how JavaScript stores and manipulates data.

## Skills Practiced

- Declaring and reassigning variables

More exercises will be added as I progress through JavaScript fundamentals.
